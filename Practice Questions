The dictionary Junior shows a schedule for a junior year semester. The key is the course name and the value is the number of credits. 
Find the total number of credits taken this semester and assign it to the variable credits. Do not hardcode this – use dictionary accumulation!

Junior = {'SI 206':4, 'SI 310':4, 'BL 300':3, 'TO 313':3, 'BCOM 350':1, 'MO 300':3}
credits = 0
for n in Junior.values():
    credits = credits + n


Create the dictionary characters that shows each character from the string sally and its frequency. 
Then, find the most frequent letter based on the dictionary. Assign this letter to the variable best_char.
sally = "sally sells sea shells by the sea shore"
characters = {}
for n in sally:
    if n in characters:
        characters[n]+= 1
    else:
        characters[n]=1
print(characters)
best_char = sorted(characters.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[-1][0]
